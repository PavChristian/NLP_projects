- [Citation analysis](https://github.com/PavChristian/NLP_projects/tree/main/citation_analysis)
This folder contains several modified code snippets that utilize scraping + API to obtain large amounts of textual data and feed them into a training pipeline.
  - [GNNs](https://github.com/PavChristian/NLP_projects/blob/main/citation_analysis/GNNs.py)
Code for preprocessing and training graph neural network on edge and node features
  - [embeddings](https://github.com/PavChristian/NLP_projects/blob/main/citation_analysis/HF_embs.py)
Code for creating text embeddings of large academic articles
  - [citations](https://github.com/PavChristian/NLP_projects/blob/main/citation_analysis/citation_transformer.py)
Code for generating appropriate node and edge features in a graph
  - [organizer](https://github.com/PavChristian/NLP_projects/blob/main/citation_analysis/organizer.py)
Code for obtaining the data using scraping and API and applying the appropriate format guidelines

- [Car reviews](https://github.com/PavChristian/NLP_projects/blob/main/car_reviews.ipynb)
This notebook contains code that leverages HF models to translate and summarize car reviews. The dataset is substantially smaller than the original version due to privacy concerns.
